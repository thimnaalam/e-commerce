    AFRICAN WEARS a South African knitwear brand founded in 2010 by Thimna Alam, originating in the desire to explore knitwear design solutions suitable for amakrwala (Xhosa initiates).
     The vision began by creating a modern Xhosa-inspired knitwear collection suitable for this market.
      Thimna, having gone through this process, felt compelled to develop premium knitwear in celebration of traditional Xhosa aesthetics.
      Through accessing and playing with the astonishing power of traditional Xhosa beadwork patterns, symbolism and colours,  AFRICAN WEARS was born.

    AFRICAN WEARS designs showcase the beauty, culture, language and aspiration of the Xhosa people. 
    AFRICAN WEARS allowed this tradition to evolve into a contemporary form that resonates with fashion markets worldwide.
    Today our brand is at the forefront of African luxury, premium and mass heritage fashion & lifestyle.
